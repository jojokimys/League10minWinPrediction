# League 10 min Win Prediction
Predicting Win with 10min of League of Legends data.
Project from INST414 class. Practice of applying different machine learning algorithms as well as data science techniques. 

You can check Google Collab notebook from the link below

## Methods
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classification
3. XGBoost
4. Neural Network (Keras)
5. Neural Network (Pytorch)

## Data
Data I will be using for this project is "high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv" from https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min

It contains columns of "blueWins" which is my target variable, and other variables such as "blueKills" or "blueTotalGold", and I will be trying to figure out what components are most important in winning a game of league during first 10 minutes of the game. Also, I will be comparing accuracy of following algorithms. ["Logistic Regression", "Decision Tree Classification", "XGBoost", "Neural Network (Keras)", "Neural Network (Pytorch)"]
