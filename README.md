# League10minWinPrediction
Predicting Win with 10min of League of Legends data

## Methods
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classification
3. XGBoost
4. Neural Network (Keras)
5. Neural Network (Pytorch)

## Data
Data I will be using for this project is "high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv" from https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min

It contains columns of "blueWins" which is my target variable, and other variables such as "blueKills" or "blueTotalGold", and I will be trying to figure out what components are most important in winning a game of league during first 10 minutes of the game. Also, I will be comparing accuracy of following algorithms. ["Logistic Regression", "Decision Tree Classification", "XGBoost", "Neural Network (Keras)", "Neural Network (Pytorch)"]
